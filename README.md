# Masters Thesis CFD in OpenFOAM

This is a repositiory containing a selection of work used for my Master's Thesis Project.
In the directory Reports, the pdf of the thesis is contained. The Direcories Case1 --> Case 20 contain OpenFOAM simulation data used in the optimisation study as seen in the main report.

In the Reports directory there is also a condensed report given to the firm supporting the project.

The full data for the simulations is not provided, given the size of the files. However, the .log files of the simulations are provided and these case files can be re-run in openFOAM to re-produce the results seen in the report.
