# Masters Thesis CFD in OpenFOAM

This is a repository containing a selection of work used for my masterâ€™s project including the thesis.

In the directory Reports, the pdf of the thesis is contained. The Directories Case1 through to Case 20 and Default contain OpenFOAM simulation data used in the optimisation study as seen in the main report.

In the Reports directory there is also a condensed report given to the firm supporting the project.

The full data for the simulations is not provided, given the size of the files. However, the .log files of the simulations are provided, and these case files can be re-run in openFOAM to re-produce the results seen in the report.
